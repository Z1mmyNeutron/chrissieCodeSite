Please see the attached concept for the additional pages to my blog to turn the blog from a stand alone blog into a blog page for a new elder law and estate planning office website. 

The home page is the first page, if it can have a banner that says "opening Monday, April 3, 2023" across the top that can be removed on April 3, 2023, that would be great. 

The second page is the Find out more page and the practice areas 

I would like to eventually add a short description of each practice area but I am still working on that list.  I can probably have it done by tomorrow. 

Then the other pages should be the existing blog. I have to update the blog's existing "How We Can Help" Page to reflect it is a law office, not just a blog. 

I have to update the blog contact page to be my new law firm email address, which still needs to be set up. 

The Link to the Archer Brogan website will have to be removed.
