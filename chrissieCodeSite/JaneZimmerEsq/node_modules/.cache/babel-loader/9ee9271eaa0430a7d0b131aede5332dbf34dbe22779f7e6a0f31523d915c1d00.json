I created a seismic design category color coded 3D map info graphic for the entire globe. This project required taking functions of latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth and digitizing them with contour points, minima and maxima and special area regions. Since this involves taking a 3D plane and converting it down to a 2D plane, tensor calculus was needed to understand how to transform from polar coordinates to Cartesian ones, as the purpose was to project a sphere/ ellipsoidal shape onto a flat surface. I obtained the first goal of transforming from 3D to 2D by creating functions to handle vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dot products to create a metric tensor.

Now as this is the raw data for the outlines of the country’s shapes, they need to be passed into the metric tensor functions for visual rendering so the contour points were able to be visualized, which needed a couple steps. First, I created a file reader in JavaScript for both of my files using async functions. I used flags, error handling and chained if statements to create a tokenizer and a parser to use. I then created a function to assign my parsed, tokenized files to their own HashMap to compared for unique keys versus duplicates, written to two separate JSON files.

No. 12-07304, July 19, 2013), the husband purchased an immediate annuity in the amount of $200,000 from his IRA proceeds, which otherwise would have had to be used to pay for his wife’s skilled nursing care. The IRA funds represented the man’s life savings intended to support himself and his wife in retirement. A federal court ordered the State of New Jersey to approve the annuity and to process the Medicaid application for his wife.\",\n]\n\n\nconst values = [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"Java\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"TypeScript\"\n]\n\n\nexport default function AttorneyProfiles() {\n    return <><Row>\n    <Col xs={12} sm={9}>\n        <h5 style={{ fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\", textAlign: \"left\", fontWeight: \"bold\", paddingLeft: \"10%\" }}>About Christina Zimmer </h5>\n        <p style={{ fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\", textAlign: \"left\", lineHeight: 2,paddingLeft: \"10%\" }}>{content.map(c => <><p style={{ paddingTop: 5 }}>{c}</p></>)}</p>\n       \n        <h5 style={{ fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\", textAlign: \"left\", fontWeight: \"bold\",paddingLeft: \"10%\" }}>Projects</h5>\n        <p style={{ fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\", textAlign: \"left\", lineHeight: 2,paddingLeft: \"10%\" }}>{projects.map(projects => <><p style={{ paddingTop: 5 }}>{projects}</p></>)}</p>\n        <h4 style={{ fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\", textAlign: \"left\", fontWeight: \"bold\", paddingLeft: \"10%\" }}>My languages:</h4>\n        <ul style={{paddingLeft:\"15%\"}}>\n                {values.map(value => <li style={{ textAlign: \"left\", lineHeight: 3, fontFamily: \"Spectral-Regular\" }}>{value}</li>)}\n        </ul>\n   \n\n    </Col>\n    <Col xs={12} sm={3}>\n        <Image\n            height=\"auto\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n            src={require(\"../media/images/jane-portrait.jpg\")}\n            rounded\n        />\n    </Col>\n</Row>\n</>\n}"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,GAAG,MAAM,qBAAqB;AACrC,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,qBAAqB;AAErC,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,uBAAuB;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAGzC,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAG,CACZ,sRAAsR,CACzR;AAED,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG,CACb,2QAA2Q,EAC3Q,0XAA0X,EAC1X,gjBAAgjB,EAChjB,mYAAmY,EACnY,2qCAA2qC,EAC3qC,i+BAAi+B,EACj+B,8nBAA8nB,EAC9nB,sgBAAsgB,EACtgB,6XAA6X,EAC7X,0YAA0Y,EAC1Y,6uBAA6uB,CAEhvB;AACD,MAAMC,cAAc,GAAG,CACnB,ucAAuc,EACvc,mrBAAmrB,EACnrB,yeAAye,CAC5e;AAGD,MAAMC,MAAM,GAAG,CACX,YAAY,EACZ,MAAM,EACN,QAAQ,EACR,UAAU,EACV,YAAY,CACf;AAGD,eAAe,SAASC,gBAAgBA,CAAA,EAAG;EACvC,oBAAOP,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAM,QAAA,eAAER,OAAA,CAACJ,GAAG;MAAAY,QAAA,gBACbR,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;QAACY,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;QAACC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAE;QAAAF,QAAA,gBACfR,OAAA;UAAIW,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,kBAAkB;YAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEC,WAAW,EAAE;UAAM,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;QAAuB;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACtInB,OAAA;UAAGW,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,kBAAkB;YAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEO,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;YAACL,WAAW,EAAE;UAAM,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACkB,GAAG,CAACC,CAAC,iBAAItB,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,eAAER,OAAA;cAAGW,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEY,UAAU,EAAE;cAAE,CAAE;cAAAf,QAAA,EAAEc;YAAC;cAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA;UAAK,iBAAG;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAEpKnB,OAAA;UAAIW,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,kBAAkB;YAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;YAACC,WAAW,EAAE;UAAM,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;QAAQ;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACtHnB,OAAA;UAAGW,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,kBAAkB;YAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEO,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;YAACL,WAAW,EAAE;UAAM,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAEJ,QAAQ,CAACiB,GAAG,CAACjB,QAAQ,iBAAIJ,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,eAAER,OAAA;cAAGW,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEY,UAAU,EAAE;cAAE,CAAE;cAAAf,QAAA,EAAEJ;YAAQ;cAAAY,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA;UAAK,iBAAG;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACnLnB,OAAA;UAAIW,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,kBAAkB;YAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;YAAEC,WAAW,EAAE;UAAM,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;QAAa;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAC5HnB,OAAA;UAAIW,KAAK,EAAE;YAACI,WAAW,EAAC;UAAK,CAAE;UAAAP,QAAA,EACtBF,MAAM,CAACe,GAAG,CAACG,KAAK,iBAAIxB,OAAA;YAAIW,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEE,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;cAAEO,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;cAAER,UAAU,EAAE;YAAmB,CAAE;YAAAJ,QAAA,EAAEgB;UAAK;YAAAR,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAM;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACtH;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAGH,eACNnB,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;QAACY,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;QAACC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAE;QAAAF,QAAA,eACfR,OAAA,CAACF,KAAK;UACF2B,MAAM,EAAC,MAAM;UACbC,KAAK,EAAC,MAAM;UACZC,GAAG,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,mCAAmC,CAAE;UAClDC,OAAO;QAAA;UAAAb,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MACT;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EACJ,iBACH;AACH;AAACW,EAAA,GAzBuBvB,gBAAgB;AAAA,IAAAuB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
