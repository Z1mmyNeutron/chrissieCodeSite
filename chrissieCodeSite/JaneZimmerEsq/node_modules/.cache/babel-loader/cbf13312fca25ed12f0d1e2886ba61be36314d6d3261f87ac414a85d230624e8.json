I created a seismic design category color coded 3D map info graphic for the entire globe. This project required taking functions of latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth and digitizing them with contour points, minima and maxima and special area regions. Since this involves taking a 3D plane and converting it down to a 2D plane, tensor calculus was needed to understand how to transform from polar coordinates to Cartesian ones, as the purpose was to project a sphere/ ellipsoidal shape onto a flat surface. I obtained the first goal of transforming from 3D to 2D by creating functions to handle vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dot products to create a metric tensor. This allowed for data to be taken in as points, put into a circle buffer which generated arcs, lines, circles and points thus satisfying the representation of contour points, minima and maxima and the special area regions. Tech: JavaScript, TypeScript NodeJS, HTML.\", \"Tokenizing and Parsing (June - August 2022): I converted excel data into usable code to compare thousands of lines of data accurately, quickly, and comfortably. To do this I created usable formulas data from excel tables. By coding inline conversion to JSON file format, I was able to export 16MB, 23MB files of excel data into JSON code in seconds. Now as this is the raw data for the outlines of the country’s shapes, they need to be passed into the metric tensor functions for visual rendering so the contour points were able to be visualized, which needed a couple steps. First, I created a file reader in JavaScript for both of my files using async functions. I used flags, error handling and chained if statements to create a tokenizer and a parser to use. I then created a function to assign my parsed, tokenized files to their own HashMap to compared for unique keys versus duplicates, written to two separate JSON files. Tech: JavaScript, JSON, Microsoft Excel, TypeScript, Node.js.\", \"Wind Maps (May- August 2021):  I added to a visual rendering of the United States designed to calculated wind zoning codes for construction permits after acquiring a list of ACII latitude and longitudes and the zoning max wind speeds. I used data as calibrating for a projection map that accounted for contours, coastal regions and special wind zones.

I created a graph with the corresponding sin waves for each individual spring rendered to allow for the visualization of the time-step.
